# R Programming

These R code projects showcase my ability to build and manipulate vectors, matrices, and data frames of various statistical and financial datasets and use that information to create beautiful visualizations right in R Studio itself and glean important business insights.


Most of the R projects located in this repository are coursework completed for the R Programming course by Kirill Eremenko (SuperDataScience) and Ligency I Team hosted on Udemy.
